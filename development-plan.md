## Technical Stack
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Storage: Browser LocalStorage
- UI Components: Custom-built with Tailwind
- Image Handling: FileReader API, browser-based processing

## Testing Strategy
- Daily testing of new features
- Cross-browser testing on major browsers
- Mobile/responsive testing on different screen sizes
- User flow validation
- Edge case testing for data handling

## Risk Management
- Backup local development progress daily
- Maintain clean, modular code to avoid technical debt
- Focus on MVP features first before enhancing
- Document complex logic immediately during implementation
- Test with real-world data scenarios
